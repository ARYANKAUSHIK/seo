HTML5 title tags help search engines show presentable text to the user that the site itself can specfic. The tag specificed on the page was blank.

Without the title tag, search engines are free to select text which will display as the heading for the page, giving unexpected and sometimes embarrassing titles pulled from the page content.

The should look like the following:

```
<head>
  <title>Hello World !</title>
</head>
```

# How do I fix this ?

Specify content for the `<title></title>` tag already defined for the page.
