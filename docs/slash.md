URL's on websites can end either with an trailing slash or without. With a trailing slash normally indicates a directory while the absense of a slash indicates a page. 

While Google has noted that the engine is smart enough to see and correct pages that work with both a ending slash and without (see more at [To slash or not to slash](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2010/04/to-slash-or-not-to-slash.html)). It is adviseable to either disable directory listing or redirect users to the appreciate version of the page without a trailing slash, just for the sake of good house keeping and optimising your site for search engines.


# How do I fix this ?
 
Please make sure that your server is set to redirect to the correct page when the page is accessed with na trailing slash, or vice versa depending on desired outcome.
