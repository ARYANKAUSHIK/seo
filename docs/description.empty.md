HTML5 description tags help search engines show presentable text to the user that the site itself can specfic. 

Search engines are not obliged to use this data (and most don't), but due to numerous new bots that might have unexpected behaviour it is recommended to include the description meta tag to ensure the page has a good looking description everywhere.

The should look like the following:

```
<head>
  <meta name="description" content="Some content of less than 160 characters that does a great job of describing your search engine listing"></meta>
</head>
```

# How do I fix this ?

You will need to populate the `content="` attribute of the already specified `<meta name="description` tag on the page
